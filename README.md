# BMIS235

The code for the website is within the folders above. You can write your code directly here on Github by clicking the little pencil icon once you click on the page that you want to edit. You can also save it to your computer and then drag and drop the file in the folder that you want it to go. You can copy all of the code from the index.html page down to the (end header) tag for all of the initialization code and the header, and then everything from (footer) through the end you can copy for the footer. Please do not edit that code so that way it can be universal between all pages. If you have any questions about how to do something, you can either text me (Riley) or put it in the issues tab. Just add an issue by clicking new issue on the right hand side of the page under the issues tab. I also have the allocation of pages below so that way we can each see what we are supposed to be doing.
